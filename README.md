# GuessWhoWebGame
Web game of Guess Who developed in HTML, CSS, and JS

This is just a version of a guess who that I produced for a client. This version is made up of 60 various cartoon characters and is seed generated so it is random each time. 

The seed generation allows for cross device play as well.
