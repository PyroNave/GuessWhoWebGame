Guess Who - Helshoogte Edition

Guess Who - Helshoogte Edition is a web-based Guess Who game tailored for the Helshoogte residence at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. Developed by Joshua Wallace, this project provides a fun and interactive way for second and higher-year students to learn the faces of new first-year residents. The cartoon images in the sample code are intended to be replaced with actual images of the first-year students.
